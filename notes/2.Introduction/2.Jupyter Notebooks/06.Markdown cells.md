Markdown cells
==============

As mentioned before, cells can also be used for text written in Markdown. Markdown is a formatting syntax that allows you to include links, style text as bold or italicized, and format code. As with code cells, you press Shift + Enter or Control + Enter to run the Markdown cell, where it will render the Markdown to formatted text. Including text allows you to write a narrative alongside your code, as well as documenting your code and the thoughts that went into it.

You can find the [documentation here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), but I'll provide a short primer.

Headers
-------

You can write headers using the pound/hash/[octothorpe](http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-oct1.htm) symbol `#` placed before the text. One `#` renders as an `h1` header, two `#`s is an h2, and so on. Looks like this:

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

```

renders as

Header 1
========

Header 2
--------

### Header 3

Links
-----

Linking in Markdown is done by enclosing text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses, like this `[Udacity's home page](https://www.udacity.com)` for a link to [Udacity's home page](https://www.udacity.com/).

Emphasis
--------

You can add emphasis through bold or italics with asterisks or underscores (`*` or `_`). For italics, wrap the text in one asterisk or underscore, `_gelato_` or `*gelato*` renders as *gelato*.

Bold text uses two symbols, `**aardvark**` or `__aardvark__` looks like aardvark.

Either asterisks or underscores are fine as long as you use the same symbol on both sides of the text.

Code
----

There are two different ways to display code, inline with text and as a code block separated from the text. To format inline code, wrap the text in backticks. For example, ``string.punctuation`` renders as `string.punctuation`.

To create a code block, start a new line and wrap the text in three backticks

```
```
import requests
response = requests.get('https://www.udacity.com')
```

```

or indent each line of the code block with four spaces.

```
    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://www.udacity.com')

```

Note: You won't see the spaces here in the page for the above! Udacity's classroom is rendering the spaces directly as a code block.

Math expressions
----------------

You can create math expressions in Markdown cells using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) symbols. Notebooks use MathJax to render the LaTeX symbols as math symbols. To start math mode, wrap the LaTeX in dollar signs `$y = mx + b$` for inline math. For a math block, use double dollar signs,

```
$$
y = \frac{a}{b+c}
$$

```

This is a really useful feature, so if you don't have experience with LaTeX, [here is a tutorial](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/) on using it to create math expressions.

Wrapping up
-----------

Here's [a cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) you can use as a reference for writing Markdown. My advice is to make use of the Markdown cells. Your notebooks will be much more readable compared to a bunch of code blocks.
