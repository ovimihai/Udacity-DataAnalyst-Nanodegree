Installing Jupyter Notebook
===========================

By far the easiest way to install Jupyter is with Anaconda. Jupyter notebooks automatically come with the distribution. You'll be able to use notebooks from the default environment.

To install Jupyter notebooks in a conda environment, use `conda install jupyter notebook`.

Jupyter notebooks are also available through pip with `pip install jupyter notebook`.
