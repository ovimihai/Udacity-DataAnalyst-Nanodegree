Managing Packages
=================

Once you have Anaconda installed, managing packages is fairly straightforward. To install a package, type `conda install package_name` in your terminal. For example, to install numpy, type `conda install numpy`.

You can install multiple packages at the same time. Something like `conda install numpy scipy pandas` will install all those packages simultaneously. It's also possible to specify which version of a package you want by adding the version number such as `conda install numpy=1.10`.

Conda also automatically installs dependencies for you. For example `scipy` depends on `numpy`, it uses and requires `numpy`. If you install just `scipy` (`conda install scipy`), Conda will also install `numpy` if it isn't already installed.

Most of the commands are pretty intuitive. To uninstall, use `conda remove package_name`. To update a package `conda update package_name`. If you want to update all packages in an environment, which is often useful, use `conda update --all`. And finally, to list installed packages, it's `conda list` which you've seen before.

If you don't know the exact name of the package you're looking for, you can try searching with `conda search *search_term*`. For example, I know I want to install [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), but I'm not sure of the exact package name. So, I try `conda search *beautifulsoup*`. Note that your shell might expand the wildcard `*` before running the conda command. To fix this, wrap the search string in single or double quotes like `conda search '*beautifulsoup*'`.

It returns a list of the Beautiful Soup packages available with the appropriate package name, `beautifulsoup4`.
