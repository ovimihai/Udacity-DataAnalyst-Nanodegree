# Ford GoBike TripData Exploration
## by Ovidiu-Mihai ANicai


## Dataset

For this analysis I used Ford GoBike dataset. I started with downloading all available data from 2018 and 2019, concatenated all files, passed through the assesment process and fixed the data quality issues I identified.
Then I explored the dataset features and tried to respond to a list of questions to understand better how people use this bike rental service. I also identified the cities where the service works and analized some features based on the city

## Summary of Findings

During the eploration I saw the increasing trend of rides in all cities, I saw how many bikes, stations and trips are in each city separately, I analized the Subscriber-Customer ratio and how many of the users are inroled in the "Bike Sharing for all" program. It was interesting to see how the distribution of the rides are during the day or the rides duration distribution. It was interesting to see how the rides are distributed through the hour of each week day, some top destinations or the correlations between the features.

## Key Insights for Presentation

The results are not that surprising, a lot of people use this services to comute to work or during weekends. During holidays people use way less the service and if some happen the rides count increase rapidly. San francisco has the biggest infrastructure for bike rental here and the interest in the city is bigger than East Bay and San Jose. Because the service has good offers a lot of the users buy subscriptions, but not many qualify for the "Bike Sharing for all" program. 
The busiest hours are during comute hours, 9am and 5pm have peak ride counts all week days. I found that the trip duration distribution is a log-normal distribution with 90% of the rides between 3 and 30 minutes.
From the total usage of the bikes I tend to belive that the operator introduced 4 batches o bikes over the time.
I confirmed my ideea that casual users use the bikes more during the weekend and their rides are longer than the subscribers daily comute.
